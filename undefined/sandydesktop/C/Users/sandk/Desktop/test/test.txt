=========================================

backup techologies:

1) Rsync - its a open souce technology to backup the files.
it supported all the platforms including windows, mac, and linux.
with a single account i could backup all the differnt platforms.

it did not support mobile backups.

2) IBENT - to overcome issue with the licensing we developed our own inhouse backup technology.
it did not support the cross platform.
if i signup on a windows machine, it will not work on mac machine and vice versa.
it also did not support linux.
it also did not support mobile

only windows and mac were supported, but it was not cross platform compatible.

3) EVS - encrypted versioning system. This supports all the platforms.
windows, mac, linux, ios, android, NAS, and we even supported windows phone.

this had slight dis advantages which will discuss later.

4) DeDup - it is almost similar to evs but there was a slight difference to overcome some inherent issues with the evs technology.

lets talk about the different backup types:

1) differential backup - 
2) incremental backup -
3) full backup  - 

1) Full backup:
lets assume we have 1 TB data, and it takes 20 hours to backup 1 TB.

day 1 - 1 TB - 20 hours - 
day 2 - 1 GB to 1 TB - 1.001 TB - its not efficient to do a full backup
day 3 - 2 GB to 1 TB - 1.002 Tb - 20 hours.

this is a very simple form of babckup ( that is full backup).


main disadvantage:
1. time it takes to backup
2. the space it occupies.

2) incremental backup:

day 1 - 1 TB - full backup
day 2 - 1 GB  files changed - i will only backup 1 GB
day 3 - 2 GB  files changed - i will only backup 2 GB
day 4 - 1 GB 
day 5 - 10 GB

we're just backing up the different amount with respect to a full backup.
state of day 5 is 1.014 TB 
state of day 4 is 1.004 TB 
state of day 3 is 1.003 TB 
state of day 2 is 1.001 TB
state of day 1 is 1 TB

day 1 - 1 TB
day 2 - 1 GB
day 3 - 2 GB
day 4 - 1 GB 

if i want to restore day 3:

full backup
day 2
day 3 - state of day 3 backup

1 Tb + 1 GB + 2 GB

day 2 -
1 GB + 1 GB\

day 5 : 

day 1 + day 2 + day 3 + day 4 + day 5
1 TB + 1 + 2 GB + 1  + 10 = 1.0014 TB

PST file:

day 1 : 10 GB - state is 10 GB
day 2 : 1 GB - state is 11 GB
day 3 : 2 GB- state is 13 GB
day 4 : 1 GB- state is 14 GB
day 5 : 10 GB- state is 24 GB

disadvantage of incremental backup:
 data has to be restored in order.

if the order goes wrong it can corrupt the backups.

restore is slow becuase the data has to be added

3) differential backup:

day 1 : 10 GB - state is 10 GB
day 2 : 1 GB - state is 11 GB
day 3 : 2 GB- state is 13 GB
day 4 : 1 GB- state is 14 GB
day 5 : 10 GB- state is 24 GB

day 1: 10 GB -       = 10 GB
day 2: 10 GB + 1 GB  = 11 GB
day 3: 11 GB + 2 GB  = 13 GB
day 4: 13 GB + 1 GB  = 14 GB
day 5: 14 GB + 10 GB = 24 GB

advantage:
restore will be faster
backup will also be faster

disadvantage:
it will occupy more space compared to incremental backup

we have impleneted incremental backups for all our backup jobs.

sql, and exchange backups we have differntial backup / incremental backup

==========================================================
Web portal

ibent:  delete, rename, move, copy is not available. only thing that you can do on the web portal is just browse through the data and just share any files of your choice.
you cannot also download a file / folder from web.

delete/ download / upload - you need to use the idrive legacy appliation

idrive legacy app, and ibackup professional app

all accounts created prior to 11-23-2011 need to use the legacy app for mac and windows.

move / copy / rename is not there on the ibent - either on web or app.

evs: move / copy / delete / rename on the web.
file  / folder uplaod available ( same limitation as below)
file / folder can be downloaded ( 2 GB for file and 650 MB for folder)

any account created after 11-23-2011 are based on evs.

idrive app and ibackup app

folder downlaod from web is only on the ibackup account and not idrive account.

dedup: delete  - you cannot move / copy / rename on the web
file / folder upload not available( same limitation as above)


any account created after  4th July 2017 is based on dedup

account created after 11/07/2018 has 30 versions, and prior to that it is 10 versions.

idrive app

rsync: move / copy / delete / rename is on the web as well.
file upload  is there but not the folder. no specified limitation.
earlier we had folder upload but that is discountinued( cuz it was based on web folders which is currently under maintenace).

ibackup app only on the rysnc




incremental or differential backup:

versioning:

all the plans that are signed up now come with 30 versions.

but account c created before nov 2018 are on 10 versions.

and only the latest version is counted towards the quota usage.

3 versions of a file.
1 GB  1st
1.2 GB -2nd version
1.3 GB -3rd version

but we only count the latest versioon for the usage.

it would be 1.3 GB in this case.
even if this file has 30 versions, and lets assume the latest version is 2 GB

thne only 2 GB is counted and not the size of all other 29 versions.


user has a 5 free accoount

 in this case the quota usages is 1.3 GB of 5 GB and not 3.5 GB ( accumulation of all 3 versions).

Also, any files moved to the trash are not counted twoards the usage.

lets assume user has 2 files
1 GB
2 GB

usage is 3 GB of 5 GB

let me remove 2 GB - it will moved to trash

1 GB of 5 GB

the user can recover this file within 30 days.

any file moved into trash will be purged automatically after 30 days.


new signups are discontinued; ibent, evs, and rsync

alll the new signups on the iddrive is in dedup
all the new signups on the ibackup is on evs
[SUCCESS] [05-26-2021 15:29:21] [[Incremental Backup][C:\Users\sandk\Desktop\archive cleanup test\anupam - day 1 - Copy - Copy.txt][Size: 5.02 MB]]

if the version count is exhausted

the oldest one will be deleted, and 29th will become 30th, 28th will become 29th and so on.

last in first out.

apart from rsync, all the other technologies backukps are vbased on file versioning.


backup 1 file to cloud
modified it and upload
modifit it again and upload

do this for 5 times.

in cloud you would have 5 versions

1. restore every version to a different location

1. version 1 folder 
2. version 2 folder
..
5. version 5 folder


snapshot:  dedup and not on evs


it will basically populate all the files backed up on or before that particular time stamp

this is a not a true implemention of a snapshot.

because this is based on file versioning.

snapshot on dedup and snapshot on rsync


backtrack - folder version restore

both backtrack and dedup snapshot work on file versioning concept, but we don't have the luxury of choosing the time & date in the backtrack.

ibent: idrive legacy or ibackup professional app

we call it as time line.

you would be choosing pre-built time stamps that are accumolated in the drop down.

backup 1 - 5:45 pm 
backup 2 - 6:00 pm


backup 10 - 10:00 pm
